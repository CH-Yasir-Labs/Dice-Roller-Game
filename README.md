# Dice-Roller-Game
This Python program simulates rolling multiple dice (1 to 15) and displays their results using ASCII art. Each die face is visually represented, and rolls can be printed horizontally for clarity. The program generates random values for each die, sums them up, and displays the total. Itâ€™s a fun and interactive way to visualize dice rolls for games or probability experiments.
